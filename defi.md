## My adventures in DeFi

DeFi, where to start.. As everything in crypto, this field is expanding faster than i can write. 

Chef Nomi's exit scam:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I did the recent move because I care about the community. I&#39;m taking IL for you. But all I received was blaming and FUDing.<br><br>Here&#39;s what happened. The devshare part of me. I converted them to <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ETH&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$ETH</a>. I stop caring about price and I will focus on the technicality of the migration.</p>&mdash; Chef Nomi #SushiSwap (@NomiChef) <a href="https://twitter.com/NomiChef/status/1302214292792422401?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 5, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Chef Nomi's return :

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I have returned all the $14M worth of ETH back to the treasury. And I will let the community decide how much I deserve as the original creator of SushiSwap. In any currency (ETH/SUSHI/etc). With any lockup schedule you wish.<a href="https://t.co/QwFj5SeeuQ">https://t.co/QwFj5SeeuQ</a></p>&mdash; Chef Nomi #SushiSwap (@NomiChef) <a href="https://twitter.com/NomiChef/status/1304442521137811457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 11, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
