## Update on HoD3D

_yay_

The core concept of the game is that it is weapon centric. What i mean is that any other item other than weapon is only for cosmetic reasons.
Sounds simple right? You get a weapon then you're done.
No way. 
There will be countless ways you can upgrade your weapon, such as silencer, scope, lazer sights, different handles etc. You will even be able to create different shooting sounds by changing to either silencer or any of the many muzzleflash hiders. Low hitchance? That might be becourse you have not taped your handle to increase grip.
Who has never dreamed about a grandelauncher attached to an AK47? All these changes done to the weapon ofcourse comes with a visual upgrade.
