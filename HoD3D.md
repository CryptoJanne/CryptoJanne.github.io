## Update on HoD3D

The core concept of the game is that it is **weapon centric**. What i mean is that any other item except the weapon is only there for cosmetic reasons.
Sounds simple right? You get a weapon then you're done.

_No way_. 

There will be countless ways you can upgrade your weapon, such as **silencer**, **scope**, **laser sights**, different **handles** etc. You will even be able to create different **shooting sounds** by changing to either silencer or any of the many muzzleflash hiders. Low hitchance? That might be becourse you have not taped your handle to increase grip.
Who has never dreamed about a **grandelauncher** attached to an AK47? All these changes done to the weapon of course comes with a visual upgrade.

# Sharing is caring.

From now on i will be starting to share my progress. I have not really felt like it before, because i was not getting the correct feeling from my game, but now i am, and it is going great in the right direction.

There are a lot of work that i have done that i am not willing to show just yet. But here are some!


![Water](https://github.com/CryptoJanne/cryptojanne.github.io/blob/master/assets/images/water.png?raw=true)

Here you can see the water I've made, It moves with the wind and splashes when it reaches the shore. I am happy with how it turned out.

![SeeThrough](https://github.com/CryptoJanne/cryptojanne.github.io/blob/master/assets/images/behindWall.png?raw=true)

This is something that i just finished, like 10 minutes ago.
I am not sure how i feel about it, but it definetly is in the direction that i am going. I definetly need to have some seethrough when walking behind walls and such, otherwise PvP would be rather booring. Please tell me what you think!!

![Shooting](https://github.com/CryptoJanne/cryptojanne.github.io/blob/master/assets/images/Shooting.png?raw=true)

The fire effect is what i am most proud of. This picture does not make it justice at all.When i started designing it i was going for something big. Something that gave a lot of feedback to the player when they fire, but i did not want to add camera shake. Mind you, this is just for the m4a1. Shotgun and other weapons will have other effects of course!

And thats it for this time around! I am working on the game almost every day, and can always be reached in my very lonely discord https://discord.gg/z9z5KB9dRR . There is so much more that i want to show you, but you got to wait some more. I am sorry!!!
