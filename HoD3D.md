## Update on HoD3D

The core concept of the game is that it is **weapon centric**. What i mean is that any other item except the weapon is only there for cosmetic reasons.
Sounds simple right? You get a weapon then you're done.

_No way_. 

There will be countless ways you can upgrade your weapon, such as **silencer**, **scope**, **laser sights**, different **handles** etc. You will even be able to create different **shooting sounds** by changing to either silencer or any of the many muzzleflash hiders. Low hitchance? That might be becourse you have not taped your handle to increase grip.
Who has never dreamed about a **grandelauncher** attached to an AK47? All these changes done to the weapon of course comes with a visual upgrade.

# Sharing is caring.

From now on i will be starting to share my progress. I have not really felt like it before, because i was not getting the correct feeling from my game, but now i am, and it is going great in the right direction.

There are a lot of work that i have done that i am not willing to show just yet. But here are some!
