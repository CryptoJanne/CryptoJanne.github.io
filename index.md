## Content

This site will contain stuff that i explore and learn. I'll post in blog format, dont hesitate to reach out via Twitter.

I am currently studying computer engineering at Malm√∂ University and therefor i have limited time to dive into things i otherwise would love to do.

But who does not love spending all their time doing math?

### Blog entries

*The first entry(after i have introduced myself) i am working on involves Ethereum and what we now call DeFi(Decentralized Finance). Hopefully i will reach and end sooner than later. But in the world of Crypto, one never knows.*
