## The end of Unity and problems faced

Lets start with explaining about the issues that over time became so much of a problem,
that i decided to **quit** Unity.

* **No official networking solution.**
<br>
  <br>
  this is for me really suprising. Unity markets itself as an "easier" alternative
  to learn game development and sure, that is true **IF** you only want to do singleplayer games. In the past unity has had an official networking solution([Unet](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UNet.html)), but for some reason fired its employees and deprecated the code. So since **2018** unity has had **NO** officially supported networking solution!! 
  <br>
  It was not until **2022** that unity announced that they had bought MLAPI and intended to start developing it as their official networking solution. Only god knows how long it will take to be able to use it in a commercial product without worrying about breaking changes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
* **There is something weirdly going on with the Input system**
<br>
  <br>
  There is something fundamentally wrong with the way Unity handles mouse input. This issue is what bugs me the most, because "the feeling" you get in a game often depends on the mouse reactability. I have no idea why it is this way, it just is. It is present in all games developed with Unity, a perfect example is
  [Escape from Tarkov](https://www.escapefromtarkov.com).
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
 * **Lack of companies using Unity and job opportunity**
<br>
   <br>
   If you are like me, and want to become a gamedev, using Unity is almost like shooting yourself in the foot. **NO** AAA game studios are using Unity / C#. Most of them have their own inhouse game engine written in c++ or are using the Unreal Engine. I have yet to see a job listing interested in hiring Unity developers.
   Which is sad, due to the enormous usage of .NET in the world
<br>
<br>
   
# My game and the future.

I am sadly announcing the canceling of "Heroes of Dystopia". The game is almost ready for release, with some minor tweaks needed, but i feel reluctant 
about releasing it. There are some issues with the networking part that i've found messy workarounds for that  does impact the game in some ways that i dont like. As well as the "feeling" controlling your character not being entirely what i wanted due to Unitys weird handeling of inputs.
I **hope** anyone that looked forward to this game has some understanding of this decision. I want my games to be associated with a great "feeling" when you controll your character, which my current game does not have.
