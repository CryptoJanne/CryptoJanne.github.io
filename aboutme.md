## About me

I am currently 29 years old. I have worked as an electritian for seven years, but during that time i was heavily involved in mining cryptocurrencies. That is what got me into this mess. God damn hardware. Anyway, the hardware part made me realize there was something very powerful in code, so i started coding. Three years ago i quit my job as an electritian and started to code full time. Right now I am studying computer engineering at Malm√∂ University. Why? Becourse i might want to go into research later in life. Why burn bridges?

Here is a picture of my current setup, i have always felt you should feel comftrible and in "zen" when you sit down and do what ever you do on your computer. That is why a cool relaxing setup is key for me. I wanna feel my best when i am coding or when im doing 100x leverage on Bitmex.
